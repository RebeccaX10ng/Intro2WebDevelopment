        <h2>It seems that in the field of art, English works are more likely to enjoy a headstart because of their
            language.

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p class="centered">
                You may find that almost all your friends from non-English countries knows a lot about English pop music
                compared to English speakers' knowledge about non-English music. Perhaps it's not beacuse English songs
                are simply better, the language itself can be a factor of succeess. In the recent best albums in 2020s
                ranking from <a
                    href="https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-100-best-albums-of-the-2020s-so-far/">Pitchfork</a>,
                only 6 of the 100 albums are not in English. We can say that international
                rankings are not only based on quality of music, but also popularity, in which language is very
                important.
            </p>
            <p class="centered">What's more, for international music softwares like Spotify and Apple Music, people
                usually have problems
                accessing to
                non-English music. Many titles of songs are roughly translated into English and aren't displayed in
                their
                original language, thus making it hard for users to find them. </p>
            <h3>Film</h3>
            <p class="centered">Hollywood produces a vast majority of the highest-grossing films worldwide. According to
                <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW">IMDb</a>, Hollywood films
                consistently dominate global box offices. All movies
                on the top-50 box office ranking are in English, and only one movie has non-English related studio
                involved, which is the Super Mario Bros Movie, which is produced by Universal Pictures, Illumination,
                and Nintendo. However, it is still made out of traditional Hollywood movie steamlines.
            </p>
            <p class="centered">Historically, the Oscars, currently the most popular film award, have overwhelmingly
                favored
                English-language films in their most prestigious categories. Until Parasite won Best Picture in 2020, no
                non-English film had ever won the top prize. In order to achieve success globally, many directors choose
                to give up their native language and produce movies in English. </p>
            <h3>Literature</h3>
            <p class="centered">Although the Nobel Prize in Literature is designed to recognize authors from around the
                world,
                English-language writers have won disproportionately more times than writers in other languages. As of
                2023, out of more than 120 recipients, about 30 have been English-language authors, including prominent
                figures like T.S. Eliot, William Faulkner, Toni Morrison, and Kazuo Ishiguro. While the prize is awarded
                globally, English literature has had a significant advantage.</p>
            <p class="centered">While English-language books are frequently translated into other languages, the reverse
                is far less
                common. According to <a
                    href="https://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/about/#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20historical%20truism,Three%20Percent%20for%20this%20site.">reports</a>,
                only about 3% of books published annually in the U.S. are
                translations, with the overwhelming majority of these being from European languages. Conversely, a
                significant portion of books in non-English-speaking countries are translations from English,
                illustrating a global reliance on English-language literature.</p>
