    <h2>It seems that in the field of art, English works are more likely to enjoy a headstart because of their language.

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
            You may find that almost all your friends from non-English countries knows a lot about English pop music
            compared to English speakers' knowledge about non-English music. Perhaps it's not beacuse English songs
            are simply better, the language itself can be a factor of succeess. In the recent best albums in 2020s
            ranking from Pitchfork, only 6 of the 100 albums are not in English. We can say that international
            rankings are not only based on quality of music, but also popularity, in which language is very
            important.
        </p>
        <p>What's more, for international music softwares like Spotify and Apple Music, people usually have problems
            accessing to
            non-English music. Many titles of songs are roughly translated into English and aren't displayed in
            their
            original language, thus making it hard for users to find them. </p>
        <h3>Film</h3>
        <p>Hollywood produces a vast majority of the highest-grossing films worldwide. According to reports from the
            Motion Picture Association (MPA), Hollywood films consistently dominate global box offices. All movies
            on the top-50 box office ranking are in English, and only one movie has non-English related studio
            involved, which is the Super Mario Bros Movie, which is produced by Universal Pictures, Illumination,
            and Nintendo. However, it is still made out of traditional Hollywood movie steamlines.</p>
        <p>Historically, the Oscars, currently the most popular film award, have overwhelmingly favored
            English-language films in their most prestigious categories. Until Parasite won Best Picture in 2020, no
            non-English film had ever won the top prize. In order to achieve success globally, many directors choose
            to give up their native language and produce movies in English. </p>
        <h3>Literature</h3>
        <p>Although the Nobel Prize in Literature is designed to recognize authors from around the world,
            English-language writers have won disproportionately more times than writers in other languages. As of
            2023, out of more than 120 recipients, about 30 have been English-language authors, including prominent
            figures like T.S. Eliot, William Faulkner, Toni Morrison, and Kazuo Ishiguro. While the prize is awarded
            globally, English literature has had a significant advantage.</p>
        <p>While English-language books are frequently translated into other languages, the reverse is far less
            common. According to reports, only about 3-5% of books published annually in the U.S. and UK are
            translations, with the overwhelming majority of these being from European languages. Conversely, a
            significant portion of books in non-English-speaking countries are translations from English,
            illustrating a global reliance on English-language literature.</p>
